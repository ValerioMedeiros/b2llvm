example-01.bimp: a minimal (incomplete) B implementation

example-01.llvm: the corresponding LLVM-IR code, resulting from the manual
		 application of the rules

example-01.tex: a LaTeX document to typeset nicely the previous two files

example-01.pdf: the PDF file corresponding to example-01.tex

scaffold-01.llvm: some LLVM-IR code scaffolding example-01.llvm
		  functions into a program interacting with the user
		  to test those functions

example-01.bc: the LLVM bitcode resulting from the compilation of the
	       manually generated LLVM code (example-01.llvm,
	       scaffold-01.llvm)

translate.py: a prototype implementation of the translation in Python, where
	      B0 input shall be defined as Python dictionaries

example_01.py: Python encoding of example-01.bimp, suitable for translation
	       with translate.py
